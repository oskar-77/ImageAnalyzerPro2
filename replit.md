# Image Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Python web application for image analysis that provides pixel exploration, statistics, conversions, and comparisons with interactive visualizations. The application is built with Flask backend and uses computer vision libraries for image processing, featuring a modern Bootstrap dark theme interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (December 2024)

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Web Framework**: Modular architecture with separated routes and business logic
- **Computer Vision Processing**: OpenCV for core image operations, scikit-image for advanced metrics
- **Scientific Computing**: NumPy for numerical operations, SciPy for statistical analysis
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for static plots, Plotly for interactive visualizations
- **File Handling**: Secure file upload with validation and UUID-based naming

### Frontend Architecture
- **Bootstrap 5 Dark Theme**: Responsive UI framework with modern dark styling
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly.js for dynamic charts and graphs
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Client-side image interaction and pixel exploration
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Consistent iconography throughout the interface

## Key Components

### Core Modules
1. **Image Exploration** (`modules/image_exploration.py`): Interactive pixel value analysis with RGB, HSV, LAB color space conversions
2. **Image Statistics** (`modules/image_statistics.py`): Comprehensive statistical analysis including brightness, histograms, and texture metrics
3. **Image Conversion** (`modules/image_conversion.py`): Format conversions, enhancements, and transformations
4. **Image Comparison** (`modules/image_comparison.py`): Similarity metrics using SSIM, PSNR, and MSE
5. **Image Utils** (`modules/image_utils.py`): Utility functions for validation and metadata extraction

### Web Components
- **Flask Routes** (`routes.py`): API endpoints for upload, analysis, and file serving
- **HTML Templates**: Base template with Bootstrap dark theme, analysis interface, and home page
- **JavaScript Frontend** (`static/js/image_analysis.js`): Interactive image clicking and dashboard functionality
- **CSS Styling** (`static/css/custom.css`): Custom styling for image display and interactions

## Data Flow

### Image Upload Process
1. User uploads image through web form
2. File validation and secure filename generation
3. Image saved to upload directory with UUID prefix
4. Image modules initialized for analysis

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Pixel Exploration**: Click coordinates converted to pixel values across color spaces
2. **Statistics Generation**: Brightness analysis, histogram calculation, texture metrics
3. **Visualization**: Plotly charts for interactive data display
4. **Report Generation**: Downloadable TXT and PNG reports

### Comparison Workflow
1. Two images uploaded and validated
2. Images resized to common dimensions
3. Similarity metrics calculated (SSIM, PSNR, MSE)
4. Visual comparison with difference maps
5. Comprehensive comparison report

## External Dependencies

### Python Libraries
- **OpenCV**: Core image processing and computer vision operations
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations
- **Matplotlib**: Static plotting and report generation
- **scikit-image**: Advanced image metrics and analysis
- **Pillow**: Image format handling and metadata
- **SciPy**: Statistical analysis and signal processing
- **Flask**: Web framework and routing
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework with dark theme support
- **Plotly.js**: Interactive charting library
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for consistent UI
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No additional frontend frameworks

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Setup
- Flask development server with debug mode
- Static file serving for uploads and reports
- File upload limits (16MB) and security measures
- Local directory structure for uploads and generated reports

### Production Considerations
- Environment variable configuration for secrets
- Secure file upload handling with validation
- Static file serving optimization
- Session management and security headers

### File Structure
